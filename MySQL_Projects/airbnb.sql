-- About Dataset
-- New York City Airbnb Data Cleaning
-- Airbnb, Inc is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Based in San Francisco, California, the platform is accessible via website and mobile app. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking. The company was founded in 2008. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com.
-- About Dataset
-- Context
-- Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in New York City
-- Content
-- The following Airbnb activity is included in this New York dataset:
-- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day
-- Data Dictionary
-- Data dictionaries are used to provide detailed information about the contents of a dataset or database, such as the names of measured variables, their data types or formats, and text descriptions. A data dictionary provides a concise guide to understanding and using the data.

-- Inspiration
-- Learn Data Cleaning
-- Data Cleaning Challenge
-- Data Cleaning Practice for beginners
-- Handling missing values
-- Handling Outliers
-- Handle inconsistent data
-- Data Visualization
-- Data analysis
-- What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
-- What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
-- Which hosts are the busiest and why?
-- Acknowledgment
-- This dataset is part of Airbnb Inside but I tried to make new columns and many data inconsistency issue to create a new dataset to practice data cleaning. The original source can be found here http://insideairbnb.com/explore/
